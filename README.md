# Beamforming
Matlab files for various types of beamforming for custom 1D, 2D and 3D arrays.

- Calculate and look at beampattern/array pattern/array factor for 1D, 2D and 3D arrays
- Calculate and look at beampattern for delay-and-sum and minimum variance beamformers
- Create input signals with multiple sources of the same single frequency arriving at different angles and with different sources
- Calculate steered response for delay-and-sum, minimum variance, MUSIC and functional beamforming algorithm
- Improve resolution with deconvolution algorithms DAMAS and CLEAN-SC
